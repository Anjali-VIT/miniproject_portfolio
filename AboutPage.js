            <p>Hi! My name is Anjali Selva. I'm currently in my second year of college at Vellore Institute of Technology in Vellore. I am pursuing my B.Tech. decree in Computer Science and Engineering with Specialization in Bioinformatics. I have loved Biology since I started learning it in 8<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>

            <p>I absolutely love nature and discovering new things about the world. I love taking walks and hiking. I've grown up travelling and am passionate about travelling and want to travel in the future. I enjoy several hobbies, some of which are dancing, painting, reading, swimming, taking pictures and listening to music.</p>

            <p>I grew up dancing. The dance style I do is called Bharatnatyam. I started dancing when I was seven years old and my passion for the art has only grown since then. In 2019 I performed my Arangetram and passed a very important and special milestone in my dance journey.</p>

            <p>Through this portfolio, I aim to share my artistic journey, showcasing my drawings, dance performances, and travel endeavors. Join me as I share my stories and experiences through pictures and articles.</p>
